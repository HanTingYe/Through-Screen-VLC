This software is for calculating the CIE chromaticity co-ordinates of phosphor materials using the photo   luminescence data.  The software also shows the position of the co-ordinates in chromaticity diagram and expected color of the material. Please note that the color predicted by the software cannot be trusted as it may change depending upon your monitor or printer settings.
